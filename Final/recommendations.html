    <h3>Suzanne Collins</h3>
      <p>In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.</p>
        <h3>My Review</h3>
 <p> A classic for any Dystopia fan, gripping and heartfelt one of the best books to ever come out of the genre.</p>

      <p>What was once the western United States is now home to The Republic, a nation perpetually at war with its neighbours. Born into an elite family in one of the Republic’s wealthiest districts, fifteen-year-old June Iparis is a prodigy being groomed for success in the Republic’s highest military circles. Born into the slums, fifteen-year-old Day is the country’s most wanted criminal. But his motives may not be as malicious as they seem.</p>
        <h3>My Review</h3>
 <p>With twists around every corner Legend will keep you guessig till the last line. With a beautifully crafted world that is deliciously twisted you will keep second guessing who you root for</p>

      <h3>Neal Shusterman & Jarrod Shusterman</h3>
        <p>AWhen the California drought escalates to catastrophic proportions, one teen is forced to make life and death decisions for her family in this harrowing story of survival! The drought, or Tap-Out, as everyone calls it, has been going on for a while.</p>
  <h3>My Review</h3>
  <p> Dry is a gripping read. It puts emphasis on complex character creation. It also focuses in on just how quickly life can be uprooted and changed forever.</p>

      </header>
      <h3>Neal Shusterman</h3>
        <p>All it takes is one hit on the football field, and suddenly Ash’s life doesn’t look quite the way he remembers it.

          Impossible though it seems, he’s been hit into another dimension—and keeps on bouncing through worlds that are almost-but-not-really his own.
          
          The changes start small, but they quickly spiral out of control as Ash slides into universes where he has everything he’s ever wanted, universes where society is stuck in the past…universes where he finds himself looking at life through entirely different eyes.</p>
   <h3>My Review</h3> 
  <p> Game Changer is quite an interesting read. You often find yourself just as confused and apprehensive as the main character. All and all I couldn't put this book down I just had to read the next chaper
