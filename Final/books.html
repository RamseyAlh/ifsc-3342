      <h3>Book One The Beginning</h3>
      <p>Two teens must learn the “art of killing” in this Printz Honor–winning book, the first in a chilling new series from Neal Shusterman, author of the New York Times bestselling Unwind dystology.</p>
        <p>A world with no hunger, no disease, no war, no misery: humanity has conquered all those things, and has even conquered death. 
          Now Scythes are the only ones who can end life—and they are commanded to do so, in order to keep the size of the population under control.</p>
          <p>
            Citra and Rowan are chosen to apprentice to a scythe—a role that neither wants. These teens must master the “art” of taking life, knowing that the consequence of failure could mean losing their own.
          </p>
        <p>Scythe is the first novel of a thrilling new series by National Book Award–winning author Neal Shusterman in which Citra and Rowan learn that a perfect world comes only with a heavy price.</p>

      <h3>Book Two Where the Real Fun Begins</h3>
      <p>The Thunderhead cannot interfere in the affairs of the Scythedom. All it can do is observe—it does not like what it sees.</p>
      <p>A year has passed since Rowan had gone off grid. Since then, he has become an urban legend, a vigilante snuffing out corrupt scythes in a trial by fire. His story is told in whispers across the continent.</p>
      <p>As Scythe Anastasia, Citra gleans with compassion and openly challenges the ideals of the “new order.” But when her life is threatened and her methods questioned, it becomes clear that not everyone is open to the change.</p>
      <p>Will the Thunderhead intervene?</p>
      <p>Or will it simply watch as this perfect world begins to unravel?</p>

      <h3>The Third Book and End of Our Arc</h3>
 <p>Citra and Rowan have disappeared. Endura is gone. It seems like nothing stands between Scythe Goddard and absolute dominion over the world scythedom. With the silence of the Thunderhead and the reverberations of the Great Resonance still shaking the earth to its core, the question remains: Is there anyone left who can stop him?</p>
   <p>The answer lies in the Tone, the Toll, and the Thunder.</p>

      <h3>Stories from the Arc of a Scythe</h3>
     <p>There are still countless tales of the Scythedom to tell. Centuries passed between the Thunderhead cradling humanity and Scythe Goddard trying to turn it upside down. 
      For years, humans lived in a world without hunger, disease, or death with Scythes as the living instruments of population control.</p>
      <p>Neal Shusterman—along with collaborators David Yoon, Jarrod Shusterman, Sofía Lapuente, Michael H. Payne, Michelle Knowlden, and Joelle Shusterman—returns to the world throughout the timeline of the Arc of a Scythe series.
