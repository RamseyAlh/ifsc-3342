        </header>
        <h3>Scythe Anastasia</h3>
        <p>Citra is very clever, although she can be short-tempered and rude at times. She is also very caring, accepting her scythe apprenticeship to ensure her brother and parent's immunity from gleaning. 
          Citra is competitive and loves to win. She is an extremely loyal person, strives for justice, realistic, and hates corruption.
        </p>
        <p>
          During her apprenticeship, she develops more empathy, compassion, and kindness for others, which is reflected in her gleaning method.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite being a world-famous scythe, she hates being the center of attention, but always handles it well, knowing what to say.

      </header>
      <h3>Scythe Lucifer</h3>
    <p>In the beginning it showed that Rowan didn’t do things because they were right, but because it made someone happy. Rowan is selfless and empathetic. 
      Rowan is still a teenager, having a crush on Citra, and looks at a girl during Goddard’s party.
    </p>
    <p>While training under Scythe Goddard, he enjoyed training his skills, which he hated himself for because it was killcraft. He pretended to go along with Godddard, but when Scythe Volta self-gleaned. Rowan breaks free from Scythe Goddards control and christens himself Scythe Lucifer and is devoteed ending corrupt scythes who are gleaning with cruelty, bias, and without compassion.</p>

      </header>
      <h3>Carson Lusk</h3>
      <p>Scythe Robert Goddard and his small group of followers, consisting of Scythe Rand, Scythe Chomsky, and Scythe Volta were the first to strongly support the new order in which scythes were encouraged to enjoy gleaning. Goddard was manipulative and did everything he could to scare away any accusations against him - going as far as blackmailing and controlling High Blade Xenocrates. 
        Goddard took on Rowan Damisch after Scythe Faraday self-gleaned, and attempted to take Citra Terranova too, but Scythe Curie intervened.</p>
        <p>
          Scythe Goddard was brutal in his approach as he trained Rowan Damisch to become the sharpest tool in the shed. He made Rowan practice on real people (though they were paid when killed) and made him capable of handling all kinds of weapons. Goddard went over the gleaning quota and attempted to glean an entire Tonist Cloister.
           He was successful, but Rowan decapitated him and incapacitated the others, and lit the Cloister on fire, supposedly ending all of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Robert Goddard was seen as a martyr among the new order scythes.
